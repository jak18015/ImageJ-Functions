# imagejScripts

This folder contains multiple scripts written in the IJMacro language for FIJI/ImageJ.

The main goal is some level of image processing, be it Z-stacked images live-cell movies, 1-channel or 2-channel.

Some files such as those labeled along the lines of file processor establish a directory heirarchy that many of the other scripts rely on.

Others like HelpfulBinner are for easily categorizing phenotypes in images quickly while recording everything.

The names are to be as descriptive as possible to allow easy findings.
Naming conventions have changed over time, but most current files follow a "xxxxxx_v[0-9][0-9]" format.

I am starting from fully self-learned macro'ing, so hopefully these will continue to look better and more concise as time goes on, with the reverse being true that the older the files are, the more likely they were written by an enthusiastic, yet fledgling, version of myself when it comes to writing scripts well.
