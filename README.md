# imagejScripts

This folder contains multiple scripts written in the IJMacro language for FIJI/ImageJ.

The main goal is some level of image processing, be it Z-stacked images live-cell movies, 1-channel or 2-channel.

The names are to be as descriptive as possible to allow easy findings.
Naming conventions have changed over time, but most current files follow a "xxxxxx_v[0-9][0-9]" format.
