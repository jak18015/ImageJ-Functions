# imagejScripts

This folder contains multiple scripts written in the IJMacro language for FIJI/ImageJ image processing and image analysis.

I am starting from fully self-learned macro'ing, so hopefully these will continue to look better and more concise as time goes on, with the reverse being true that the older the files are, the more likely they were written by an enthusiastic, yet fledgling, version of myself when it comes to writing scripts well.
